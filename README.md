# ðŸŒŸ Excited to share that Iâ€™ve just completed my first task during my internship at Prodigy Info Tech! 
# ðŸŽ‰ I created an interactive navigation menu that:

-- Changes color or style on scroll or hover
-- Has a fixed position and is visible on all pages
-- Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure, styling, and interactivity
-- You can check out the project here: GitHub Repository
